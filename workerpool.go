// WorkerPool dispatches tasks to a fixed pool of goroutines.
//
// # Backpressure
//
// When the task queue is full, the pool's behavior is controlled by the
// OverflowPolicy configured at construction time:
//
//   - OverflowBlock (default): Submit blocks until a worker drains a slot.
//     Provides backpressure. WARNING: do NOT use from a gnet event-loop
//     goroutine — blocking the event loop stalls ALL connections on that
//     reactor. Use NewEventLoopWorkerPool for event-loop callers.
//
//   - OverflowReject: Submit returns immediately without executing the
//     task. The caller detects this via SubmitErr's error return.
//     Submit (the no-error API) silently drops the task.
//
//   - OverflowSpawn: Submit spawns a new goroutine to run the task. This
//     is the legacy behavior, now EXPLICIT — callers must use
//     NewEventLoopWorkerPool or NewWorkerPoolWithConfig with
//     Overflow: OverflowSpawn. Under sustained overload it can create
//     unbounded goroutines; use only when the caller cannot tolerate
//     blocking (e.g., a network event loop).
//
// # Allocation model
//
// Tasks are submitted as func() values. The pool does NOT wrap each task
// in a per-Submit closure — panic recovery lives in the worker loop, so
// the only per-Submit allocation is the func() value itself (which the
// caller creates).
//
// # Shutdown state machine
//
// Shutdown uses a two-phase close to avoid TOCTOU races:
//
//  1. Close the `done` channel — wakes up any blocked Submits and causes
//     future Submits to return ErrPoolClosed.
//  2. Wait for all in-flight tasks to complete (wg.Wait).
//  3. Close the `tasks` channel — workers drain remaining queued tasks
//     and exit.
//
// The `done` channel is used in EVERY Submit path's select, so a closed
// pool cannot panic on "send on closed channel" — the select always has
// the `<-p.done` case to catch it.
//
// # Safety
//
//   - Submit is safe to call concurrently from multiple goroutines.
//   - Submit after Shutdown returns ErrPoolClosed (SubmitErr) or is a
//     silent no-op (Submit).
//   - A panicking task is logged and recovered — the worker continues.
//   - Workers exit cleanly when the tasks channel is closed.
//   - Shutdown is idempotent (safe to call multiple times).
